This Python script allows you to check if an IP address is flagged as a threat based on a threat intelligence database stored in a CSV file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tharunaditya/Enhancing-Cyber-Resilience-The-Role-of-Threat-Intelligence-in-Risk-Management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Enhancing-Cyber-Resilience-The-Role-of-Threat-Intelligence-in-Risk-Management
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages (NumPy and pandas) if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```

4. Create a `threat.csv` file with the threat intelligence data. You can customize this file to include the IP addresses, categories, and descriptions of threats.

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python threat_intelligence.ipynb
   ```

6. Enter the IP address you want to check when prompted.

7. The script will then check if the IP is flagged as a threat and display the results.

## CSV File Format

The `threat.csv` [Download Sample file](https://github.com/Tharunaditya/Enhancing-Cyber-Resilience-The-Role-of-Threat-Intelligence-in-Risk-Management/blob/dd8955597c27a7bc0a88d4d0457c4a4396d814c6/threat.csv) 

This file should have the following format:

```
IP,Category,Description
192.168.1.1,Malware,Known malware-infected IP
10.0.0.1,Phishing,Reported phishing source
172.16.0.1,DDoS,Source of DDoS attacks
# Add more entries as needed
```

You can modify and expand this file with additional threat data.
